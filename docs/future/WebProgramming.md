Web Programming
===============

Level 5


Description
-----------

Web technologies are a foundation of modern software. Web technologies facilitate networked applications that are easily deployable. Web technologies can facilitate realtime interaction/communication.

Students are to understand the foundations of web technology (server/client separation).
The focus of the module is to accrue practical web programming skills.
By understanding web foundation technologies, students will have the prerequisite knowledge to work with more advanced libraries.
This module is to be delivered using bare-bones IDEs, standard language libraries and common builtin browser development tools.


This module attempts to give students the opportunity to practically interact with a range of core web technologies:

* Modern HTML boilerplate structure
* HTTP Server
* WebSockets
* Document Object Model
* Modern CSS (including transitions and variables)
* HTML Canvas (including shape paths and requestAnimationFrame)
* Web Forms (POST)
* Browser Events
* Cookies/Sessions
* JSON
* Async requests
* HTML Offline Storage
* Simple Deployment mechanisms
* URL components (scheme, domain, path, hash, query string)
* BASE64 encoding (of images)


Once the students have engaged with the above technologies in a practical way, students are to use CDIO methodology to conceive, design and implement a simple practical project to demonstrate a range of skills acquired.
Template project ideas will be provided to support weaker students.
More advanced students will be encouraged to be creative with their implementation.
Students will be asked to demonstrate their understanding by adding a feature to another students' project. This will support students ability to read code and use industry standard tools for collaborating on a software project while ensuring that students are individually accountable for their work.

Complex datastores (sql) [databases] and Network infrastructure (https/certificates, DNS) [networking] are out of scope of this module, but should be mentioned.


Learning Objectives
-------------------

1. Develop the skills to independently develop and deploy a simple web application using foundation/standard technologies
2. Describe the purpose and use of a range of server and client foundation technologies
3. Engage with industry standard developer tooling


### Expanded

1. Understand the HTTP protocol
    * be able to describe the structure of a HTTP request and HTTP response
    * by implementing a HTTP sever from scratch using raw sockets
2. Understand WebSockets by implementing a WebSocket EchoServer and creating browser clients that can send messages via this server
3. Understand that webpages are based on a Document Object Model that can be manipulated with code (createElement, remove, querySelector)
4. Understand that DOM elements can be styled/animated with CSS (transition)
5. Understand that complex custom shapes can be drawn with code using Canvas
6. Understand that data can be POST'ed by forms. This can be stored and returned with a GET requests
7. Understand that server and client can share data with cookies
8. Understand that data structures can be encoded and decoded from strings (json)
9. Understand that all IO in browsers is performed by asynchronous non blocking calls
10. Understand that browsers have a range of build in api's e.g. offline storage, webcam, midi
11. Understand how to use developer tooling that is built into modern web browsers effectively
    * Network requests, Console/REPL, builtin debugger
12. Understand how to deploy simple web-apps
13. Understand that rather than raw web technologies are a foundation. Complex problems often require the structure of established frameworks (linking to next module 'Programming Languages and Frameworks')
14. Understand the tools software engineers use to collaborate on code projects (version control)


Learning and Teaching Strategies
--------------------------------

* The module will be taught in a lab using mixed mode delivery as required, so that theory, practical and discussion can take place as required within one session.
* Students will demonstrate progress in their assignment and will have the opportunity to gain feedback of their understanding in each session through the artefacts they are working on.
* Students are to use version control and engage with 'professional behaviours' like code review and pair programming
* In industry, it is expected that developers engage with code-base's they are unfamiliar with add features. The final assessment of this module is for students to add a feature to another students project (preferably via a pull-request for students to understand the tooling professional developers collaborate on software).


Indicative Assessment 
---------------------

| Name | Type | Module % | Word equivalent |
|-|-|-|-|
| Guided Projects | Log Books | 25% | 1000 |
| Personal Project | Digital Artefact + Code Review Presentation to Peers | 50% | 2000 |
| Feature Addition to another students personal project | Digital Artefact | 25% | 1000 |


### Assessment Strategy
* Logbooks
    * The initial foundation skills are built using a range of guided tasks. Students will be heavily guided with the solutions but should submit regular ongoing progress as logbooks to demonstrate engagement and practical understanding of the core technology foundations.
* Individual Project
    * Using the pallet of ‘foundations’ built from the logbooks. Students are asked to create a demo/bare-bones/mvp implementation of a product (see examples in indicative module content)
    * Projects should be documented (in markdown) with setup/run instructions (see next project/assessment)
    * These projects are to be presented to peers in a manner that professional engineers will ‘code review’ their solutions. It is expected that participants of the ‘code review’ ask questions and ask the prester to describe their process and justify their design decisions. As a code review group, there should be suggested ‘action points’ to improve the solution.
    * The assessment is based on the following dimensions.
        * Quality of the solution
        * Quality of presentation (technical language)
        * Quality of suggested improvements
* Individual Project – Expand another’s project
    * Students fork/clone a peers project and attempt to add a new feature.
    * Students are to use industry tools (pull request) to (possibly asynchronously) comment and discuss the proposed solution before the ‘pull request’ is merged. 
        * The above flow mirrors the flow of a professional code project and collaboration.
    * The assessment is based on the following dimensions
        * Quality of feature addition (demoed)
        * Quality of comments (technical language, questioning, suggestions)

* It is expected that peers are given clear guidance and a rubric on peer assessment criteria. Moderated by members of academic staff.
* Where possible the assessment should be focused on student understanding and professional ways of working rather than just a ‘one dimensional code only submission’.



•	(Training tasks)
o	The initial foundation skills are built using a range of guided tasks. Students will be heavily guided with the solutions but should submit regular ongoing progress as logbooks to demonstrate engagement and practical understanding of the core technology foundations.
•	Individual Presentation (Code Review)
o	Using the pallet of ‘foundations’ built from the logbooks. Students are asked to create a demo/bare-bones/mvp implementation of a product (see examples in indicative module content)
o	Projects should be committed to version control (to allow reviewing of code)
o	These projects are to be presented to peers in a manner that professional engineers will ‘code review’ their solutions.
o	Code review structure:
	Describe the purpose of the software.
	Demo the software working.
	Project documented (in markdown) with setup/run instructions (see next project/assessment)
	Take participants through the journey of how the software work by explaining and commenting on each line of code. Everybody should understand how the code functions and continually asking questions to verify they all have the same understanding. 
	Justifying design decisions 
	Taking on board action points and accrue a list of ‘action points’ or ‘suggested improvements’.
	Code reviews are an active process for all participants. There should be no passive observers in code reviews.
o	An assessment rubric should be based on the following dimensions.
	Quality of the solution
	Quality of presentation (technical language)
	Quality of discussion/inquiry/collaboration
	Quality of next steps, conclusions, suggested improvements.
o	There is no need for “PowerPoint” or any other presentation software. This is a ‘code review’.
o	The use of whiteboards, paper or visualisers are encouraged.
o	The working code should be submitted for TurnitIn for reference.

•	Individual Presentation (Code Review) – Feature Addition
o	Students fork/clone a peers project and attempt to add a new feature.
o	Students are to use industry tools (pull request) to (possibly asynchronously) comment and discuss the proposed solution before the ‘pull request’ is merged. 
	The above flow mirrors the flow of a professional code project and collaboration.
o	The feature addition is to be code reviewed (see above). It us up to code owner if they ‘approve’ the pull request.
•	It is expected that peers are given clear guidance and a rubric on peer assessment criteria. Moderated by members of academic staff.
•	Where possible the assessment should be focused on student understanding and professional ways of working rather than just a ‘one dimensional code only submission’
