Module Overview
---------------

<sub>Hint: Take notes .... seriously! ... get a notepad, or open a text document. Get ready!</sub>

TASK: (10min) 
* Find - the module handbook - read
* Whiteboard - What do you think is in this module?

## Module Aims
To develop the studentâ€™s understanding of the fundamental concepts of Programming Frameworks and Languages. 
This module supports the Implement and Operate elements of the CDIO model.

* [module_handbook.md#employable-skills](./module_handbook.md#employable-skills)

### Intended Learning Outcomes 
By the end of the module students should be able to:
1. Demonstrate an understanding of the concept of a Framework in general, a Framework used for Programming, and a Framework used for software Testing
2. Critically evaluate the effectiveness of a particular framework for an application and platform
3. Synthesise a small digital artefact using a well-formed programming framework

Whiteboard in half: words to describe (10min)
* What is a [programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language)?
* What is a [software framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_framework)?

The sign of an amateur:
> _TECH_XYZ_ is rubbish
This module will help develop an important part of your professional skill-set: 
* The ability to discuss and reason about technology choices

* The ability to use a professional toolchain (CI)
* Understand the basic elements of full stack web development


### Definitions

* Language
  * A formal structure to describe machine behaviour
* Framework
  * Inversion of control
    * It calls you, rather than you call it
* Tests that are
  * Automated
  * Document business requirements/spec
  * Document correct flow

### How will we learn

1. Focus on a business engineering problem with real industry tools
  * Hands-on each week with a range of tools
2. Discussion
  * Real engineers can discuss/reason about technology
  * Pair programming (you have to verbally describe your rational)
3. Multiple languages/frameworks (they are all just tools that you can learn)
  * [langauge_reference.html](https://computingteachers.uk/static/langauge_reference.html)
4. Self directed (Level 6) 150 hours
  * You can read + action on your own now


#### Level 6
* Level 4 - You are told what to do
* Level 5 - Supported developing competency in a range of problem domains
* Level 6 - You are able to self direct (with support)

* My role is NOT to have all the answers
* My role is to facilitate your transition towards a skilled professional

Side Note: Employment. Popular languages? Less popular or new languages? Mark scheme 50%+

#### Session Overview - Online/Campus

Task: Look on blackboard at session list

* Each week
    * 09:00 - 13:00 Lab
    * 14:00 - 18:00 Supervised Workshop Support
      * First 3 week (vital)
      * can be flexible later in the module

  * https://codespaces.new/calaldees/frameworks_and_languages_module
  * https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/calaldees/frameworks_and_languages_module
```bash
make
make run_example_server_client
# https://8001-xxxx.ws-eu67.gitpod.io?api=https://8000-xxxxx.ws-eu67.gitpod.io
```
put link on blackboard - class interact

  * Client Framework (browser app logic)
  * Client Layout Framework (styles + visuals)
* Assignments
  * Set Today
  * Assignment 1 - Digital Artifact - Due 11th December
  * Assignment 2 - Technical Report - Due 8th January
* Tools
  * Cloud based IDE + containers
  * OpenAPI Spec


Run it yourself (30 min)
------------------------

* Cloud based VSCode IDE
  * GitHub CodeSpaces
    * [120 hours a month](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-github-codespaces/about-billing-for-github-codespaces)
  * GitPod
    * [50 hours a month](https://www.gitpod.io/pricing)
    * Create account with GitHub login

Demo:
1. The IDE
2. The Interaction (public port)
  * launch containers
  * make ports public
3. Add an item with the web interface
  * Remember to add the querystring for the server `?api=` e.g. `https://8001-xxxx.ws-eu67.gitpod.io?api=https://8000-xxxxx.ws-eu67.gitpod.io`
4. Access another persons public port + Add an item to another persons server
5. Run the tests
  * `make test_example_server`
  * `make test_example_client`
    * (Demo this natively to show Cypress interface. We will return to this in session 4 in more detail)


Task: Fork + Run + Commit (30 min)
----
1. Fork your own copy of the repo (description)
  * Allow CI
    * And enable _GitHub Actions/Workflows_
2. Start a Cloud based IDE for YOUR FORK 
  * `https://codespaces.new/<USERNAME>/<REPO_NAME>`
  * `https://gitpod.io#PASTE_YOUR_GITHUB_FORK_URL_HERE`
3. Make a commit to `/server/Dockerfile` and see CI
  * ```Dockerfile
      FROM python:alpine
      WORKDIR /app/
      COPY . .
      CMD ["python", "-m", "http.server", "8000"]
      ```
  * `git status`
  * `git diff`
  * `git commit -a`
  * `git push`
4. See you test report online on GitHub
  * GitHub -> YOUR FORK -> Actions -> `test_server` -> server-junit
  * or
  * commit -> red 'x' next to commit -> test_server/server-junit (push)


Workspace Hygiene
------------------
* Commit + push: every time any progress is made (even one or two lines of code)
  * Your workspaces are ephemeral and should be disposed periodically - workspaces are not a datastore
* Stop your cloud IDE's (save your cloud hours)
  * `gp stop`
  * `gh codespace stop`
* Manage/Delete unused workspaces (remove unused workspaces)
  * https://github.com/codespaces/
  * https://gitpod.io/workspaces

* (Optional)
  * [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack) - with cccu address + cccu id

  * Are present for the expressjs, vuejs, bootstrap examples (but they can be skipped for the truly l33t). 
  * Full implementation across different languages independently.
  * Will pass at 75%+
* Students that don't attend the afternoon support sessions
  * Don't waste my time asking for help the week before the assignment is due

### Working day?
* I/we are here 09:00 to 18:00 Mondays
* Welcome to a full time job
* If you want to be a software engineer, expect this every day, with only 20 days holiday a year until you are 68

### Who are you working for?
* You will spend the rest of your life working for someone else and working for their objectives
* Currently you are working for you
  * If you don't utilise this time now, we call this 'friendly fire'

### Job prospects

This module has the most industry aligned skills in the entire degree suite.
A combination of this and your final year project are going to be the linchpin modules of your entire degree.
Put in the time.
