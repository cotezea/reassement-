Assignment - Technical Report
=============================

Overview
--------

Create a 1600 word technical report.
This will be 40% of this module.

* You will demonstrate your understanding of the frameworks and languages you have experimented with in your _digital artefact_ assignment
* You will use domain specific and technically accurate language/terminology


Intended Learning Outcomes 
--------------------------

* LO 1. Demonstrate an understanding of the concept of a Framework in general, a Framework used for Programming, and a Framework used for software Testing.
* LO 2. Critically evaluate the effectiveness of a particular framework for an application and platform.


Submission Guidance
-------------------

* GitHub Public Fork (auto snapshot)
    * You will clone a public fork of:
        * [https://github.com/calaldees/frameworks_and_languages_module](https://github.com/calaldees/frameworks_and_languages_module)
    * At the datetime of the deadline a snapshot of your fork will automatically be taken
    * It is industry practice to keep technical documentation alongside program code in the same code repository
        * Project documentation is often written in `Markdown`
    * A Markdown report template has been provided [`./technical_report.md`](https://github.com/calaldees/frameworks_and_languages_module/blob/main/technical_report.md)
    * You will edit/commit `technical_report.md` markdown file in-place in your cloned fork repository. (do not rename the file)
* Submit a pdf file to TurnItIn
    * In addition to GitHub, You need to formally submit a `pdf` file with the contents of your report to TurnItIn
    * Converting MarkDown to PDF for TurnItIn submission
        * ```bash
            alias pandock='docker run --rm -v "$(pwd):/data" -u $(id -u):$(id -g) pandoc/latex'
            pandock technical_report.md -o technical_report.pdf
            ```
* Please see section in Module handbook "Formative Assessment" for verification of student understanding


Marks Overview
--------------

* The rubric is marked from 0 to 100
* 1600 words
    * Code blocks and references do not contribute to word count
* Your writing should be short, sharp, technical and meaningful
    * Make a clear point every 40-ish words


Scenario
--------

* Freecycle-Inc have an existing working prototype for their FreeCycle platform with tests. 
* The business executives can see the existing prototype 'working'. They want to continue to expand the existing solution `./example_server/` `./example_client/` into a full commercial product.
* As a "Software Engineer" You are to create a "Technical Report" for the business leadership.
* You have explored/created/used a range of frameworks by creating example implementations (This is what you produced for Assignment 1)    
* Your report should
    * Explain why the current prototype `./example_server/` `./example_client/` (without frameworks) should not be used as the foundation for future enhancements.
    * Explain the features the frameworks offer (referencing technical documentation for those features)
        * Give code examples of these features from your experiments
    * Explain the features the language used by the framework offers
        * Give code examples of these features from your experiments
    * Use correct technical domain specific terminology
    * Reference your sources of information (Documentation for frameworks/languages, tutorials, opinion blogs comparing frameworks or evangelising a framework, etc)
  
Produce a summary technical report to the business directors (1600 words total).


Suggested Report Structure
--------------------------

### Introduction

* A summary of the purpose of this report, it's intended audience, an overview of the content.

### Critique of framework-less prototype

* A technical critique of why the existing prototype implementation is not fit for business use
    * `./example_server/` Server prototype critique
    * `./example_client/` Client prototype critique
* Each prototype critique should contain
    * A code snippet example demonstrating the feature/pattern
    * Explain why this pattern is problematic

### Framework Features

Describe the features of the frameworks and explain the problem that they are solving.

* Headings
    * 3 * Server framework features
    * 3 * Client framework features
* Each feature should contain
    1. Technical description of the feature
    2. A code block snippet example demonstrating the feature 
        * code blocks do not count towards word count
        * If you should additionally 'permalink' to the snippet in your own code from assignment1
    3. Explain the problem this feature solving (why was the feature created), benefits/problems
    4. Provide reference urls to your sources of information about the feature
        * references do not count towards word count

### Language Features

Describe the features of the language and explain the problem that they are solving.

* Headings
    * 2 * Server language features
    * 2 * Client language features
* Each feature should contain
    * (see above)
* To access the higher mark bands, the server and client should be different languages for you to demonstrate your wider knowledge of language differences.



Guidance
--------

* Level of Expectation
    * Realistically; You are not a lead developer. You are not expected to write this to a true industry standard. You are trying to demonstrate to an external examiner your knowledge and understanding of these technologies.
* Technical reports heavily used bullet points. You do not need to write in full english paragraphs all the time.
* Formative feedback of written work will be provided throughout module delivery.
    * It is expected that you will be incrementally working on your writeup (assignment2) alongside your digital artifact (assignment1) and committing regularly.
* Your justifications need to be supported with references. 
    * Show links to developer documentation, blog articles and case studies that support your technical assessment/recommendations.
    * Note: with _Academic Writing_ it is an institutional policy to use Harvard style referencing.
        * Most of the references will be url's in the form:
            * Example 1:
                * inline `(Using Express middleware, no date)`
                * in bibliography `Using Express middleware (no date). Available at: https://expressjs.com/en/guide/using-middleware.html (Accessed: 9 August 2023).`
            * Example 2:
                * `(Dreimanis, 2021)`
                * `Dreimanis, G. (2021) “Phoenix: An Introduction to Elixir’s Web Framework,” Serokell Software Development Company [Preprint]. Available at: https://serokell.io/blog/introduction-to-phoenix (Accessed: 9 August 2023).`
        * Read about referencing URLs at:
            * https://www.scribbr.co.uk/referencing/harvard-website-reference/
* Phrases like 'makes it faster/easier/bugfree' are not technical and will not gain marks. You need to justify 'why' a feature enhances 'what' process. e.g.
    * > The 'auto-reload' feature supports developers in reducing the cognitive/mechanical overhead of manually restarting the development server. The feedback time to experiment with code changes is reduced. This should reduce development time. Below is an example of autoreload is enabled in the developer settings file and a url to it's documentation.
    * > The framework is structured so that Components can have the html/structure/layout to be in the same file as the language/logic. This ability to have multiple languages in a single file helps reduce the cognitive overhead of developers juggling multiple files and helps reduce the footprint of code changes, making diffs more readable. Developers can more easily identify changes to specific features, this should help reduce the time it takes to identify and resolve bugs in future. Below is an example of a simple Clock component which demonstrate logic and layout in the same file using xxx framework (url of course of documentation/example).
    * > The feature of list types having built in `map`, `filter` and `reduce` methods, allows for single line of code can succinctly express multiple transformations rather than having to manually iterate over a collection multiple times with multiple intermediary collections. This reduces the code footprint (the lines of code a developer has to cognitively process) and also allows the individual transformations to be reused/shared/imported in other parts of the application that may be processing data in a similar way. This reduces duplication and leads to more consistent data processing. below is a code example of the same transforms performed with CSharp Enumerables and without.
    * > The Django Framework enforces a specific file layout for each 'Django app' that is registered. If we were creating smaller REST microservice, this separation of concerns/files layout creates a large amount of boilerplate that developers have to produce. Smaller frameworks (like expressjs) are more suitable for REST microservices as a whole service can be defined in a single file if needed. A single file is more readable/succint and deployable. The problem could come when expanding an expressjs application over time, developers need to to create/invent their own more complex file structures/separations that may not follow known established patterns (Fictitious author blog article, 2020).
