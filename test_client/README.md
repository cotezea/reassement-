I have my own old notes about cypress
https://github.com/calaldees/cypress-for-ci

https://docs.cypress.io/examples/examples/docker#Images

* [Run Cypress with a single Docker command](https://www.cypress.io/blog/2019/05/02/run-cypress-with-a-single-docker-command/)

The official images seem to have the same reports problem from 3 years ago - maybe some of my old hacks will help

why is `cypress/included` 3GB!?

```cmd
    # ADMIN
    choco install nodejs
    # in test_client dir
    npm install cypress

    set CYPRESS_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8001/?api=http://localhost:8000
    npx cypress open --e2e --browser electron
    # always fails on first installed run
```
